    <P>
        Hello! I am currently pursuing a Digital Media degree in game design at UCF, with a focus in level design.
        At the time of writing this, I am senior and planning on graduating UCF at the end of spring in 2026.
        While I focus on level design, I have also been working on and specializing in UI-design and Narrative.
        <br /><br />
        Game design has always been a pashion since I was in middle school. I would often go home and write out ideas, mechanics, and characters
        for my own games. I would spend hours making my own board games, forcing my family to play them, or make my own obstacle courses and challenges 
        within sandbox games like minecraft.

    </P>
