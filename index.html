    <P>
           Hello! I am an aspiring Game designer currently studying at the Univerisity of Central Florida. 
        As of writing this, I am a senior about to enter my final semester for my Bachelor's degree in Digital Media for Game design!
        During my time here at UCF, I am studying level design, with a special focus on UI design and Narrative Design.
        <br /><br />
           I have loved games ever since I was a kid, regardless if it was a board game or video game. I have always had a love for making games, 
        as I would constantly create games, or alter existing ones when I was younger and force my family to play them. When I was in middle school, I became
        interested in game design, and would spend hours on end in sandbox games and level editors like Minecraft and Super Mario Maker. It was not until 
        late high school where I decided to focus on game design as a career.

    </P>
