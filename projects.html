<h3> Reconnection </h3>
<h4> 2025-2026 Workshop Project (WIP)</h4>
<h4> Role: Tech Lead/UI Designer</h4>
<p> Reconnection is a game about old friends reconnecting 
    through a tabletop RPG akin to Dungeons and Dragons. It is a narrative-driven game
    that emphasizes the choices the player makes when interacting with their fellow players. 
    This project consists of 8 team members, and is being developed in Unreal Engine.
    <br/><br/>
    My role in this project is the Tech Lead, where I oversee what is being implemented in engine, who is currently in engine,
    and managing when we build our project. I am also a UI designer and level designer for this project. For UI design, I have worked on
    designing layouts for our combat screen, Real World Scenes, Dialogue, and Exploration Scenes. I am also responsible for adding functionality
    to these menus through Unreal's Blueprints. Working with our only programmer, we came up with a dialouge system for our game utilizing blueprints and the comabt system
    reminiscent of old school RPGS. I have also designed the layout for our settings menu, as well as implementing functionality to the menu through blueprints.
