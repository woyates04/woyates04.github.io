<h3> Fearosis </h3>
<h4> 2025 Casual Game Production Project</h4>
<h4> Role: Level Designer, UI designer</h4>

<p>    Fearosis is a simulation styled game for mobile devices. In the game, you pick an evil entity, ranging from an evil Ai, to a disease that turns people into monsters.
    Your goal is to upgrade your entity, and infect everyone with monsterism. You accomplish this through upgrades, which increases one or more of your stats: Fear, Notoriety, Prejudice, and Pain.
    These stats interact with each other, and each day, the population of the town you are trying to infect will respond with events. These events will affect your stats that you recieve from upgrades,
    either increasing. decreasing the amount gained when upgraded.
    Our team consisted of 7 members, and was developed using the Unity Engine.

       I designed the UI layouts for the game. My main focus for this project was to design an intuitive layout for mobile devices in mind, a field I have never worked on before.
    I had to design a layout that was simple to navigate, but had a lot of empty space so the player can see what was going on in the town.
    The layout I ended up finalizing was condensing buttons into small tabs, as it compacted everything to a small area of the screen, and would allow players to take in only a few buttons per menu. 
    This idea was carried over to all screens in the game, splitting upgrades into four tabs, menus into separate tabs, as well as other features such as credits and player statistics.
    This created a streamlined experience for the player, as they could easily travel to whichever menu they needed through the main dropdown, without it feeling overwhelming or too complex.
    This design created an uncluttered layout that did not obscure the main spectacle of the game, being the people turning into monsters in the town.
    <br/><br/>
    I also created all of the upgrades, creating the pathway for each one and assigning upgrade values correlating to the theming of the upgrade.
    Each upgrade also had a description, providing flavor to each of the upgrades that gave insight into not only what the player was doing,
    but the world they were affecting.

<h3> Creature Carnival </h3>
<h4> 2025 Game Production Project</h4>
<h4> Role: Level Designer/Tech</h4>

<p>  Creature Carnival is a 3D platformer where you play as a magical balloon animal escaping the clutches from evil ring leader.
    Our team consisted of 9 members and was developed using Unity
    <br/><br/>
    My role in this project was level designer, specifically working on our 'monkey' level. This level focused on climbing up to the top of a huge circus.
    I designed the layout of the level, as well as importing all assets into the scene. I also worked on making simple animations within unity for the jellyfish enemies.
    While my main focus was the monkey level, I also worked on the initial layout design for the 'Rhino' level as well.
