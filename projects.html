<h3> Reconnection </h3>
<h4> 2025-2026 Workshop Project (WIP)</h4>
<h4> Role: Tech Lead/UI Designer</h4>
<p>    Reconnection is a game about old friends reconnecting 
    through a tabletop RPG akin to Dungeons and Dragons. It is a narrative-driven game
    that emphasizes the choices the player makes when interacting with their fellow players. 
    This project consists of 8 team members, and is being developed in Unreal Engine.
    <br/><br/>

    <p>   My role in this project is the Tech Lead, where I oversee what is being implemented in engine, who is currently in engine,
    and managing when we build our project. I am also a UI designer and level designer for this project. For UI design, I have worked on
    designing layouts for our combat screen, Real World Scenes, Dialogue, and Exploration Scenes. I am also responsible for adding functionality
    to these menus through Unreal's Blueprints. Working with our only programmer, we came up with a dialouge system for our game utilizing blueprints and the comabt system
    reminiscent of old school RPGS. I have also designed the layout for our settings menu, as well as implementing functionality to the menu through blueprints.

<h3> Fearosis </h3>
<h4> 2025 Casual Game Production Project</h4>
<h4> Role: Level Designer, UI designer</h4>


</div>

<p>    Fearosis is a simulation styled game for mobile devices. In the game, you pick an evil entity, ranging from an evil Ai, to a disease that turns people into monsters.
    Your goal is to upgrade your entity, and infect everyone with monsterism. You accomplish this through upgrades, which increases one or more of your stats: Fear, Notoriety, Prejudice, and Pain.
    These stats interact with each other, and each day, the population of the town you are trying to infect will respond with events. These events will affect your stats that you recieve from upgrades,
    either increasing. decreasing the amount gained when upgraded.
    Our team consisted of 7 members, and was developed using the Unity Engine.

<p>
       My main role for Fearosis was designing the layouts for the UI during gameplay, making sure it
    scaled properly for mobile devices. One goal I had for the layout of the game was to make sure it was not too cluttered
    for the player so they would not get overwhelmed with a bunch of different options. This also allowed them to watch the little people
    run around the town. The solution was to condense the different tabs into a single button that would dropdown to reveal the four buttons
    that would take the player to the different screens. The screen I worked the most in layouting was the upgrades screen. The upgrade screen needed to showcase
    four different tabs of types of upgrades, with each tab having ten upgrades a piece, along with a place to provide descriptions and information for each upgrade.
    Making sure the layout was not too cluttered, the best solution we found was to have each button be represented with an icon, which when clicked would populate a
    the visualizer to the left, which would show the upgrade name, description, cost, and the button to activate it. This kept the screen simplle and uncluttered, leading
    to a more streamlined user experience.
    <br/><br/>
       My other Role was creating Upgrades and Events for each of the different monsters. Each monster would have 40 upgrades in total, with 10 for each type.
    These 10 would then be put on an 'updgrade tree', where certain upgrades had to be unlocked first, before later ones could be purchased. This gave me restrictions, as I had to keep in mind which specific
    monster I was writing for, which type of upgrade (For example, blood type for Skinwalker), and where it stood within the upgrade tree. Even with these restrictions, it was fun writing them,
    with each tree acting sort of like a narrative, where as upgrades progressed, the intenser they got. Not only the amount of points given, but what they did within the world of Fearosis.

<h3> Deadtective </h3>
<h4> 2025 Jamsepticeye Game Jam</h4>
<h4> Role: UI Designer/Level Designer</h4>

<p>    Deadtective is a point and click adventure game where you play as a detective, retracing the clues and solving the case to a murder, putting the spirit that haunts the house to rest.
    As the detective, you are able to enter the spirit world, finding clues that you normally couldn't have in the real world.
    Our team consisted of 7 team members, and was developed in less than 5 days using the Unity Engine.
    <br/><br/>
    My role in this project was to create the layout that the player will use to navigate the different rooms of the house.
    Our initial plan was to have the player move within the house, however, due to limited time that had to be changed.
    Our new plan was to have multiple screens the player would navigate, by clicking a button on each side of the screen.
    For example, clicking up would go up to the bedroom, and clicking button on the bottom of the screen would take you back to where you were before.
